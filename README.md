# Overview

DrG is a tiny software to draw regular graph. Note that regular graph here is not the "regular graph" in algebra, and it only represent these graphs which is regular or composed of regular graphs. 

# Motivation

I'm not a professional painter but I often need to paint some graphs for my blogs or posts. I don't want to use some big painting software like Painter. I ever used mspaint that is a built-in painting software in windows, but it's a little hard to draw regular graphs using it. However, I find it easy to do it using MS PowerPoint, so I want to create a tiny painting software which can draw graphs as MS PowerPoint does.


It is being developed ...
